# cryptomarket-react-app

## Cryptocurrency Market React App

This App analyses and process an historical price list of cryptocurrencies provided by a currency exchange and clearly present this information to a customer.

I have developed this App using ReactJS along with HTML5, CSS3, ES6+... Starting the development with [create-react-app](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/). ReactJS has achieved a massive growth in modern web applications
and I'm always keen to expand my skills with new modern technologies.

Due timing circunstances, I'm fetching the json data from a file instead of building an API and I have decided to focus the development on front end only.

I have also created some simple unit test cases to start with.

Some comments are included in "//"" along the code to describe the functionality.
